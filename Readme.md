## Project Management

### Methodology

#### Agile - Scrum

The team will utilise an Agile - Scrum methodology to ensure flexible and robust
development that is centered around client input. This entails receiving a prioritised list of tasks and requirements (Backlog) from the client (Product Owner). These tasks will be organised into Sprints where the team will complete a set of tasks from the Backlog in a set timeframe - usually two to three weeks. The team will meet daily to give progress updates regarding the current sprint (Daily Scrums). After the completion of each Sprint a review will be held (Retrospective) where the team reviews their work and discusses ways to improve the next Sprint.
