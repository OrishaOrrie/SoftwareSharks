This is a document that sets out how to run the Keras training model

DEPENDENCIES(to be installed):

(saves and restores models)
pip install h5py 

(Other python dependencies)
pip install numpy scipy 
pip install pillow
pip install requests

(Make sure tenserflow is installed)

(Install Keras)
pip install keras

SETUP:

1.1) Create two folders called "train_dir" and "val_dir"
1.2) Add classification folders to these two folders
1.2.1) Make sure the classifications are the same
For Example:
	\train_dir
		\AllanKey
		\BinzelTorch
		\CombinationSpanner
		\TapeMeasure
		\TowBelt
	\val_dir
		\AllanKey
		\BinzelTorch
		\CombinationSpanner
		\TapeMeasure
		\TowBelt
1.3) In line 47 of predict.py file change labels to match these classification classes

CREATE AND TRAING MODEL:

Run the fine-tune.py file with the addition of arguments:
 --train_dir <path to train_dir>
 --val_dir <path to val_dir>
 --nb_epoch <number of Epochs to use>
 --batch_size <size of batch>
 --output_model_file <name of file to save model to>
 --plot <true or false>

PREDICT:

Run the predict.py file with the addition of arguments:
 --image <path to image on local computer>
 --image_url <link to online image>
 --model <name of model file to use>
