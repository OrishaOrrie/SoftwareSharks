Our combined changelog and roadmap. It contains todos as well as dones.

Items can be optionally be tagged tagged by GitHub owner issue if discussion
happened / is needed.

Please add your entries in this format:

 - `- [ ] (<plugin name>|website|core|meta|build|test): <Present tense verb> <subject> \(<list of associated owners/gh-issues>\)`.

Following [SemVer spec item 4](http://semver.org/#spec-item-4),
we're `<1.0.0` and allowing ourselves to make breaking changes in minor
and patch levels.

In the current stage we aim to release a new version on the
last Friday of every new month.

## Backlog

Ideas that will be planned and find their way into a release at one point

- [ ] core: Decouple rendering from Plugin ?
- [ ] core: Make sure Uppy works well in VR
- [ ] test: Human should check http://www.webpagetest.org and https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/, use it sometimes to test website and Uppy. Will show response/loading times and other issues
- [ ] test: Human should test with real screen reader to identify accessibility problems
- [ ] test: setup an HTML page with all sorts of crazy styles, resets & bootstrap to see what brakes Uppy (@arturi)
- [ ] dependencies: es6-promise --> lie https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie ?
- [ ] core: accessibility research: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb, http://khan.github.io/tota11y/
- [ ] core: consider adding presets, see https://github.com/cssinjs/jss-preset-default/blob/master/src/index.js (@arturi)
- [ ] uppy/uppy-server: Transfer files between providers (from instagram to Google drive for example).
- [ ] uploaders: consider not showing progress updates from the server after an upload’s been paused (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] maybe restrict system file picking dialog too https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/253
- [ ] uppy-server: what happens if access token expires amid an upload/download process.
- [ ] good way to change plugin options at runtime—maybe `this.state.options`?
- [ ] s3: multipart/"resumable" uploads for large files (@goto-bus-stop)
- [ ] DnD Bar: drag and drop + statusbar or progressbar ? (@arturi)
- [ ] possibility to work on already uploaded / in progress files #112, #113
- [ ] possibility to edit/delete more than one file at once #118, #97
- [ ] optimize problematic filenames #72
- [ ] an uploader plugin to receive files in a callback instead of uploading them
- [ ] statusbar: add option to always show
- [ ] have a `resetProgress` method for resetting a single file, and call it before starting an upload. see comment in #393
- [ ] “Custom Provider” plugin for  Dashboard — shows already uploaded files or files from a custom service; accepts an array of files to show in options, no uppy-server required #362
- [ ] WordPress plugin
- [ ] Transformations, cropping, filters for images, see #53
- [ ] Prepare for (piwik-) tracking of usage of uppy ? see #83
- [ ] screenshot+screencast support similar to Webcam #148
- [ ] Webcam modes #198
- [ ] feature: improved UI for Provider, Google Drive and Instagram, grid/list views
- [ ] feature: React Native support
- [ ] consider iframe / more security for Transloadit/Uppy integration widget and Uppy itself. Page can’t get files from Google Drive if its an iframe; possibility for folder restriction for provider plugins
- [ ] It would be nice in the long run to have a dynamic package builder here right on the website where you can select the plugins you need/want and it builds and downloads a minified version of them?
Sort of like jQuery UI: https://jqueryui.com/download/
- [ ] test: add https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y for automated accessibility testing?
- [ ] test: add tests for `npm pack`
- [ ] test: add deepFreeze to test that state in not mutated anywhere by accident #320
- [ ] audio: audio recording similar to Webcam #143
- [ ] add typescript definitions and JSDoc everywhere? https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Type-Checking-JavaScript-Files
- [ ] transloadit plugin: maybe add option to disable uppy server endpoint overrides
- [ ] dragdrop: change border color when files doesn’t pass restrictions on drag https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/607
- [ ] website: automatically generated page with all locale strings used in plugins
- [ ] transloadit: option for StatusBar’s upload button to act as a "Start assembly" button? Useful if an assembly uses only import robots, such as /s3/import to start a batch transcoding job.

## 1.0 Goals

What we need to do to release Uppy 1.0

- [ ] QA: test how everything works together: user experience from `npm install` to production build with Webpack, using in React/Redux environment (npm pack)
- [ ] QA: test in multiple browsers and mobile devices again
- [ ] QA: test uppy server. benchmarks / stress test. multiple connections, different setups, large files (10 GB)
- [ ] QA: tests for some plugins
- [x] docs: on using plugins, all options, list of plugins, i18n
- [ ] feature: preset for Transloadit that mimics jQuery SDK, check https://github.com/transloadit/jquery-sdk docs
- [ ] refactoring: possibly add CSS-in-JS
- [x] refactoring: possibly switch from Yo-Yo to Preact, because it’s more stable, solves a few issues we are struggling with (onload being weird/hard/modern-browsers-only with bel; no way to pass refs to elements; extra network requests with base64 urls) and mature, “new standard”, larger community
- [ ] refactoring: split uppy into small packages, lerna repo?
- [x] QA: tests for core and utils
- [x] feature: Redux and ReduxDevTools support (currently mirrors Uppy state to Redux)
- [x] feature: beta file recovering after closed tab / browser crash
- [x] feature: easy integration with React (UppyReact components)
- [x] feature: finish the direct-to-s3 upload plugin and test it with the flow to then upload to :transloadit: afterwards. This is because this might influence the inner flow of the plugin architecture quite a bit
- [x] feature: restrictions: by size, number of files, file type
- [x] refactoring: webcam plugin
- [x] uppy-server: add uppy-server to main API service to scale it horizontally. for the standalone server, we could write the script to support multiple clusters. Not sure how required or neccessary this may be for Transloadit's API service.
- [x] uppy-server: better error handling, general cleanup (remove unused code. etc)
- [x] uppy-server: security audit
- [x] uppy-server: storing tokens in user’s browser only (d040281cc9a63060e2f2685c16de0091aee5c7b4)
